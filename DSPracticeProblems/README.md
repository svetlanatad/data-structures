**Data Structures and Sorting Algorithms Practice** :)
**SuffixProducts**:  The code below, you may find Big-O characterization, in terms of n.
It also implements alternative method fast Version that performs the same task efficiently. You may find justification of time and space complexities.
**LinkedQuickSort**:  The task implements quick-sort for a singly-linked structure of unique integer values.

(b) Implements a generic method, that given the first node of a singly-linked structure, prints its
contents.
(c) Implements a generic method that, given an array of generic values, creates a singly-linked structure containing the values and returns the first node of the sequence.
(d) Implements a method that, given the first node of a singly-linked structure, sorts it using the quick-sort algorithm. The pivot should always be the first element of the sequence. The sequences smaller and greater should be constructed by relinking the existing nodes. You are not allowed to create any new objects. In the end, the first node of the sorted sequence should be returned.

**HexBucketSort**:  Implements an efficient bucket-sort algorithm to sort an array of Hexadecimal (base-16) digits. The symbols used to represent digits in Hexadecimal notation are 0–9 and A−F. Uses an appropriate Wrapper class to represent the digits. The buckets are Stacks. 
Add a main method to you class and test your program.

**LinkedMatrix**: Linked structure of Linked Matrix :)
 (a) Creates a generic static inner class representing a node with capabilities to store an element and be linked to a node below/to the right. The class has accessors and mutators for all the fields.
(b) Adds a generic method that, given the upper-left node of such a structure, prints all elements in column-major order.
(c) Adds a generic method that, given a two-dimensional array of elements, creates a linked structure corresponding to it and returns the upper-left node.
(d) Adds a main method to test the two methods.
**ArrayDeque**:  Efficiently implements the Deque interface using an array as an underlying structure. The class includes an implementation of all the Deque methods as well as two constructors – one with a default capacity of 16, and one with a custom capacity. Some of the mutator methods throw an IllegalStateException if the underlying container is full.
**ReverseQueue**:  A single generic method that both removes every second element and reverses the contents of a queue.
